## Folder structure
The folder structure chosen is alternative three. A more stack-like approach.
I chose this because this seems to be the more scalable option for a company you wouldn't know how big will grow. 
It keeps all the functioning objects seperate from each other, letting you cluster together smaller blocks of functions with the modules, into larger stacks with a spesific purpose.
After this stack is made you finally tie everything together in the global folder and let all that needs to talk together, talk together.
